## About

The **Polymath Protocol** is a comprehensive, first-principles curriculum for mastering the foundational knowledge required to innovate across deep tech sectors. This program integrates mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, chemistry, and biology into a unified educational framework.

**Philosophy:** True innovation stems not from narrow specialization, but from deep, integrated mastery of the fundamental languages of science and engineering. Master the universal foundations first, then apply them across multiple deep tech domains.

**Total Duration:** 4-7 years (depending on pace)  
**Prerequisites:** High school mathematics  
**Approach:** Sequential dual-learning (application + theory for each subject)
