# Phase I: Universal Foundations
**Duration:** 24-36 months | **Prerequisites:** High school mathematics | **Commitment:** 20-30 hours per week

## Overview

Phase I builds the complete mathematical and scientific foundation required for all advanced deep tech innovation. This is the bedrock upon which all subsequent knowledge is built—innovation in deep tech is impossible without fluency in these first principles.

## Learning Philosophy: The Dual-Learning Approach

For each core subject, study through **two complementary lenses**:
1. **Application & Intuition** - Build geometric/computational understanding essential for engineering
2. **Theory & Rigor** - Develop abstract, proof-based foundations crucial for advanced topics

This sequential two-pass approach ensures both practical utility and deep theoretical understanding.

## Phase Structure

| Module | Duration | Focus | Prerequisites |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------|
| **[Module 1: Mathematics](module-1-mathematics/)** | 8-12 months | Complete mathematical toolkit | High school math |
| **[Module 2: Physics](module-2-physics/)** | 10-14 months | Fundamental laws of nature | Module 1 |
| **[Module 3: Chemistry & Biology](module-3-chemistry-biology/)** | 6-10 months | Matter and life principles | Modules 1-2 |

## Resource Strategy

**Primary Approach:** Free online resources (MIT OCW, Khan Academy) combined with curated textbooks for both practical applications and theoretical depth.
