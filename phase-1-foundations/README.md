# Phase I: Universal Foundations

**Duration:** 24-36 months  
**Prerequisites:** High school mathematics  
**Commitment:** 20-30 hours per week

## Overview

Phase I builds the complete mathematical and scientific foundation required for all advanced deep tech innovation. This is the bedrock upon which all subsequent knowledge is built - innovation in deep tech is impossible without fluency in these first principles.

## Learning Philosophy: The Dual-Learning Approach

For each core subject, you'll study through **two complementary lenses**:

1. **Application & Intuition** - Build geometric/computational understanding essential for engineering
2. **Theory & Rigor** - Develop abstract, proof-based foundations crucial for advanced topics

This sequential two-pass approach ensures both practical utility and deep theoretical understanding.
