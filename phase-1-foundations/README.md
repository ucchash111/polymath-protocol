# Phase I: Universal Foundations
**Duration:** 24-36 months  
**Prerequisites:** High school mathematics  
**Commitment:** 20-30 hours per week

## Overview

Phase I builds the complete mathematical and scientific foundation required for all advanced deep tech innovation. This is the bedrock upon which all subsequent knowledge is built—innovation in deep tech is impossible without fluency in these first principles.

## Learning Philosophy: The Dual-Learning Approach

For each core subject, study through **two complementary lenses**:

1. **Application & Intuition** - Build geometric/computational understanding essential for engineering
2. **Theory & Rigor** - Develop abstract, proof-based foundations crucial for advanced topics

This sequential two-pass approach ensures both practical utility and deep theoretical understanding.
