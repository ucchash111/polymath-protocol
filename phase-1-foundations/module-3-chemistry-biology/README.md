# Module 3: Foundational Chemistry & Biology
**Duration:** 6-10 months  
**Prerequisites:** Module 1 Mathematics, Module 2 Physics (especially thermodynamics and quantum mechanics)  
**Commitment:** 15-20 hours per week

## Overview

This module establishes an understanding of the principles governing the structure and transformation of matter and the logic of living systems. This foundation is critical for the "wet" deep tech fields of biotechnology, materials science, and nanotechnology.
