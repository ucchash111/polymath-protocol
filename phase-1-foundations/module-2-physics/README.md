# Module 2: Foundational Physics
**Duration:** 10-14 months  
**Prerequisites:** Module 1 Mathematics (especially calculus, linear algebra, differential equations)  
**Commitment:** 20-25 hours per week

## Overview

This module aims to develop a deep understanding of the fundamental laws governing energy, matter, space, and time. The goal is to cultivate the ability to "think like a physicist"—to analyze unfamiliar problems, make order-of-magnitude estimations, and apply core principles to new domains. The structure mirrors the core physics curriculum at institutions like MIT and Stanford.

## Learning Philosophy: Physics First Principles

Physics is fundamentally about understanding the underlying patterns and principles that govern the universe. Each topic builds upon mathematical foundations from Module 1 and connects to real-world applications in deep tech.
