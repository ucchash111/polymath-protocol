# Module 1: Foundational Mathematics
**Duration:** 8-12 months  
**Prerequisites:** High school mathematics  
**Commitment:** 15-20 hours per week

## Overview

This module builds the complete mathematical toolkit required for all advanced physics and engineering disciplines, focusing on the ability to model, analyze, and solve complex quantitative problems. It mirrors the core undergraduate mathematics curriculum of top-tier engineering programs like MIT's.

## Learning Philosophy: Dual-Learning Approach

For each mathematical subject, study through **two complementary lenses**:

1. **Application & Intuition** - Build geometric/computational understanding essential for engineering
2. **Theory & Rigor** - Develop abstract, proof-based foundations crucial for advanced topics

This sequential two-pass approach ensures both practical utility and deep theoretical understanding.
