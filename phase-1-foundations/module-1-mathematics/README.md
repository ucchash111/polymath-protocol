# Module 1: Foundational Mathematics
**Duration:** 8-12 months  
**Prerequisites:** High school mathematics  
**Commitment:** 15-20 hours per week

## Overview

This module builds the complete mathematical toolkit required for all advanced physics and engineering disciplines, focusing on the ability to model, analyze, and solve complex quantitative problems. It mirrors the core undergraduate mathematics curriculum of top-tier engineering programs like MIT's.

## Learning Philosophy: Dual-Learning Approach

For each mathematical subject, study through **two complementary lenses**:

1. **Application & Intuition** - Build geometric/computational understanding essential for engineering
2. **Theory & Rigor** - Develop abstract, proof-based foundations crucial for advanced topics

This sequential two-pass approach ensures both practical utility and deep theoretical understanding.

## 1.1-1.2 Single Variable & Multivariable Calculus
**Duration:** 12-16 weeks

### Overview
Calculus is the starting point for describing change and accumulation, concepts fundamental to all physical sciences. Multivariable calculus extends this to three spatial dimensions (and beyond) necessary to describe fields (electromagnetic, gravitational) and fluid mechanics.

### Topics
**Single Variable Calculus:**
- Limits, continuity, derivatives (definition, rules, applications like optimization and related rates)
- Integrals (definite, indefinite, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
- Techniques of integration (by parts, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions)
- Applications of integration (area, volume, arc length, work)
- Infinite series and Taylor series

**Multivariable Calculus:**
- Vectors and vector algebra
- Partial derivatives, gradients, divergence, curl
- Multiple integrals (double, triple)
- Line integrals, surface integrals
- Fundamental theorems of vector calculus: Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem

### Study Plan
- **Week 1-8:** Complete MIT 18.01 (single variable)
