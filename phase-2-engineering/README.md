# Phase II: The Engineering Core

**Duration:** 18-24 months  
**Prerequisites:** Phase I completion  
**Commitment:** 25-35 hours per week

## Overview

Phase II translates the abstract principles of science into the concrete practice of engineering. This phase is about learning to design, analyze, and build systems that function reliably and efficiently in the real world.

Modern engineering is defined by two cross-cutting themes:
1. **Computation** is the fundamental toolkit of all engineering fields
2. **Systems thinking** is essential for managing complexity and integration

## Learning Philosophy

Engineering excellence requires mastering both:
- **Theoretical foundations** - Why do methods work?
- **Practical implementation** - How do you build real systems?

This phase emphasizes **hands-on projects** alongside rigorous theory, preparing you to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and technological innovation.
